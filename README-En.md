# Chinese Diabetes Question Classification Evaluation 2023
## 1. Task content
The Chinese diabetes question classification Check task aims to automatically classify diabetes related questions raised by patients.As a typical chronic disease, diabetes has become one of the major global public healthchallenges. With the rapid development of the Internet, the huge group of type 2 diabetes patients and high-risk people has shown an increasing demand for specializedinformation on diabetes. The automated diabetes Question Answering (QA) services also play a vital role in providing daily health services for patients and high-risk people.This task will help to enhance the performance of search results and promote the development of diabetes automatic question answering service.

The Chinese diabetes questions included in the task dataset are divided into six categories. Participants need to predict the classification of diabetes questions in the test set.After the prediction is completed, you only need to fill in the missing classified data of the test data set. In the evaluation phase, you only need to analyze the error of the filled data to get the predicted performance score.Please do not change the information in other parts of the dataset, such as the length of the data, the name of the dataset file, etc.

## 2. Evaluation standard
The task uses the accuracy (Acc, Accuracy) as the evaluation index, and the formula is as follows

$Accuracy  = \frac{Predict\ the\ correct\ number\ of\ samples}{Total\ number\ of\ predicted\ samples}$

## 3. Scale and distribution of evaluation data
